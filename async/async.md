# Async/Await Notes
> going to be implemented in the Rust programming language soon

Async functions return immediately when they are called -- none of the code in their body is executed. They return a future, representing the state machine of their body transitioning from async to await until it finally returns the final value. 

*You always know that none of the body of the async function will be evaluated until you begin polling the future it returns.*

> "*async/await is not just about avoiding combinators; it completely changes the game for borrowing*" - [Turon](http://aturon.github.io/2018/04/24/async-borrowing/)

**Why do we need `async/await` if we have futures?**
Although the `Future` trait does not explicitly impose a `'static` bound, futures have to be `'static` because they are not tied to any particular stack frame. This means that futures-based APIs are forced to take ownership of whatever they need, thereby coercing unidiomatic patterns, including threading through ownership as well as the overuse of `Rc` and `RefCell`.

async/await enables the programmer to `await` a future with borrowed data, while still being `'static` overall (@withoutboats refers to this as "borrowing across yield points")...this proposal enables fully idiomatic Rust code that runs asynchronously.

## Async IO

*What if we want to handle a large number of simultaneous connections, many of which are waiting for I/O, but we want to keep the number of OS threads to a minimum? **The answer is Asynchronous I/O**.

In Asynchronous I/O, we can *attempt* an I/O operation without blocking; if it can't complete immediately, you can retry at some later point.
