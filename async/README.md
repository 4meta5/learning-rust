# Futures => Async/Await

* [`futures`, `async/await`](./notes.md)
* [networking](./networking)

To define a custom `future`, you typically import the following:

```rust
use futures::prelude::*;
use std::pin::Pin;
use task::{Waker, Poll};
```

[SRC](https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/wakers-i/): The async/await pattern in Rust is comprised of three fundamental components:
1. **futures** are like a pause-able computation (really a proxy for an eventual response; compile down to state machines)
2. the **executor** schedules futures by polling them when they are ready to make progress
3. the futures depend on **event-sources** (for async IO, this is called the **reactor**). The **event-source wakes the executor** when an event occurs that will allow the future to make progress

Once a future is spawned onto an executor, that future gets executed to completion using a three phase cycle.:
1. **Poll**: The executor polls the future, which computes until it reaches a point at which it can no longer make progress.
2. **Wait**: The reactor or event source registers that the future is waiting on an event to occur. The future has returns `Poll::Pending` and the event source is now tracking that it will need to wake this future when that event is ready.
3. **Wake**: The event happens and the future is woken up. It is now up to the executor to schedule the future to be polled again.

The asynchronous **event loop** <br>
**Executor** manages the program's compute resources + **reactor** manages the program's IO resources
