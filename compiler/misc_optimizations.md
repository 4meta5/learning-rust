## Misc Optimizations

* a loop over a vector is significantly slower than over the vector as slice; it's noticeably faster to iterate over a slice rather than a `vec!`
* `.iter.map(|x| x.0.into()).collect`
* **using `BtreeMap<T, ()>` to test for deduplication** for cache optimality (trading search efficiency in some cases...)
    * using a different scope for this pattern
* `format!` macro to `write!` macro to make it so that you don't have to create new objects in the heap

//! # Small Vector Optimization
//!
//! By default, the value-set for each key in the map uses the `smallvec` crate to keep a
//! maximum of one element stored inline with the map, as opposed to separately heap-allocated
//! with a plain `Vec`. Operations such as `Fit` and `Replace` will automatically switch
//! back to the inline storage if possible. This is ideal for maps that mostly use one
//! element per key, as it can improvate memory locality with less indirection.

### MISC NOTES

* MAPS USE BLAKE2
* STORAGE VALUES USE TWOX

BLAKE2 IS 6X SLOWER THAN TWOX
but if you have keys in your map, that can be manipulated from the outside; an attacker could try to create hash collisions.
Moreover, for the map, you can set the hasher you want to use => look up the correct hash for your type in the metadata.
