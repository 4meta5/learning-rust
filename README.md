# Rust Playground

This repo is my playground for learning Rust.

# Projects
* zencryption (command line encryption tool)
    1. symmetric encryption
    2. asymmetric encryption
    3. eventually, I want to implement **proxy re-encryption** in Rust (think NuCypher and Umbral)
* workout app 
    * integrate HashMap with closures (lazy evaluation/memoization code pattern)
* pwasm-nft-example
    1. ecr 165
    2. surrounding solidity contracts
    * consider using/contributing to 'solc' (Solidity to Rust compiler)
* RadicalTCR
