[Product-Form Solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product-form_solution): particularly efficient form of solution for determining some metric of a system with distinct sub-components, where the metric for the collection of components can be written as a product of the metric across the different components.

[Jackson Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_network): a class of queueing network where the equilibrium distribution is particularly simple to compute as the network has a product-form solution.

[Arrival Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrival_theorem): The state of node i as seen by an incoming job has a different distribution from the state seen by a random observer. For instance, an incoming job can never see all 'k jobs present at node i, because it itself cannot be among the jobs already present.
