# Practice

These are just code patterns for me to practice; usually limited to one file code patterns rather than larger repos.

* Linked List in Rust
* Recurrence Rust macros practice
* Quickstart `error_chain!` scaffolding
* Conversion for practicing `From` and `Into`

## Todo
* combinators (`and_then` and `map`) -- [blog](https://hermanradtke.com/2016/09/12/rust-using-and_then-and-map-combinators-on-result-type.html)
* parsers and lexers
