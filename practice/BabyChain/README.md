# BabyChain

A simple blockchain implementation for new Rustaceans who are also interested in blockchains. It serves to exemplify the `struct`-`impl` patter, how traits are used in Rust to define shared behavior, and other concepts from [the Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

> My plan is to write a Rust tutorial using this project; would be cool to have multiple versions with increasing difficulty (similar to the Linked List tutorial from abeinges)
