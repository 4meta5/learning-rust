# BabyChain
> still considering `<naming>`

A simple blockchain implementation for new Rustaceans who are also interested in blockchains. It serves to exemplify the `struct`-`impl` patter, how traits are used in Rust to define shared behavior, and other concepts from [the Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

> Model after `abeinges` linked list tutorial; should have something at the end of each chapter for them to use...

## Chapter One
* basic data structures
    * hash functions
    * merkle trees
* `struct-impl` pattern 
* `trait` as an interface

---

## Chapter N
* use [this basic blockchain tutorial](https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46) with [TinyChain](https://github.com/Kayryu/TinyChain/tree/master/src)
* use [Parity-Bitcoin]() -- add Proof of Work
* add Proof of Stake

## Chapter N+1
* NPoS
* introduce Libp2p for networking
* introduce `async/await` and use [Hyper, Tokio, Futures](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/getting_started/http_server_example.html)
