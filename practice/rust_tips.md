# Cleanup

This section is about improving clarity.

## Combating Rightward Pressure

After sparring with the compiler, it's not unusual to stand back and see several nested combinator chains or match statements. Much of the art of writing clean Rust has to do with the judicious application of de-nesting techniques.

### Basics

* Use `?` to flatten error handling, but be careful not to convert errors into top-level enums unless it makes sense to handle them at the same point in your code. Keep separate concerns in separate types.
* Split combinator chains apart when they grow beyond one line. Assign useful names to the intermediate steps. In many cases, a multi-line combinator chain can be more clearly rewritten as a for-loop.

### Tuple Matching

If you find yourself writing code that looks like:

```rust
let a = Some(5);
let b = Some(false);

let c = match a {
    Some(a) => {
        match b {
            Some(b) => whatever,
            None => other_thing,
        }
    }
    None => {
        match b {
            Some(b) => another_thing,
            None => a_fourth_thing,
        }
    }
};
```

it can be de-nested by doing a tuple match:

```rust
let a = Some(5);
let b = Some(false);

let c = match (a, b) {
    (Some(a), Some(b)) => whatever,
    (Some(a), None) => other_thing,
    (None, Some(b)) => another_thing,
    (None, None) => a_fourth_thing,
};
```

# Blocks for Clarity

Blocks allow us to detangle complex expressions, and can be used anywhere that a one-liner expression would be valid.

## Closure Capture

Specifying variables for use in a closure can be frustrating, and it's common to see code that jumps through hoops to avoid shadowing variables. This is quite common when cloning an `Arc` before spawning a new thread that will own it. But a closure definition is an expression. Anywhere a closure is accepted, we could use a block that evaluates to a closure. In the example below, we use blocks to avoid shadowing the config that we want to pass to several threads, without creating gross names like `config1`, `config2` etc... Seen in
[salsa](https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa/blob/3dc4539c7c34cb12b5d4d1bb0706324cfcaaa7ae/tests/parallel/cancellation.rs#L42-L53) and described in more detail in [Rust pattern: Precise closure capture clauses](http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2018/04/24/rust-pattern-precise-closure-capture-clauses/#a-more-general-pattern).

Before, painfully avoiding shadowing config:

```rust
fn spawn_threads(config: Arc<Config>) {
    let config1 = Arc::clone(&config);
    thread::spawn(move || do_x(config1));
    
    let config2 = Arc::clone(&config);
    thread::spawn(move || do_y(config2));
}
```

After, no need to invent config_n names:

```rust
fn spawn_threads(config: Arc<Config>) {
    thread::spawn({
        let config = Arc::clone(&config);
        move || do_x(config)
    });
    
    thread::spawn({
        let config = Arc::clone(&config);
        move || do_y(config)
    });
}
```

# Ergonomics

One of the most important aspects of feeling at peace with the Rust programming language is to find harmony with the compiler. We've all introduced a single error and been whipped in the face by dozens of error messages. Even after years of professional Rust usage, it can feel like a cause for celebration when there are no errors after introducing more than a few new lines of code. Remember that the strictness of the compiler is what gives us so much freedom. Rust is useful for building back-ends, front-ends, embedded systems, databases, and so much more because the compiler knows how long our variables are valid for without using a garbage collector at runtime. Any lifetime-related bug that fails to compile in Rust might have been an exploitable memory corruption issue in C or C++. The compiler pain frees us from exploitation and gives us the ability to work on a wider range of projects.

## Unification and Reading the Error Messages That Matter

Rust requires that arguments and return types are made explicit in function definitions. The compiler will use these explicit types at the boundaries of a function to drive type inference. It will take the input argument types and work from the top of the function toward the bottom. It will take the return type and work its way up. Hopefully they can meet in the middle. The process under the hood is actually a [little more complicated than this](http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2017/03/25/unification-in-chalk-part-1/) but this simplified model is adequate to reason about this particular subject. The point is, there has to be an unbroken chain of type evidence that connects the input arguments to the return type through the body. When there is a gap in the chain, all ambiguous types will turn into errors. This is partially why rust will emit many pages of errors sometimes when there's actually only a single thing that needs to be fixed.

A big part of avoiding compiler fatigue is to just filter out the errors that don't matter. Start with the first one, and work your way down. See the next section for a command that will do this automatically when your code changes.

## Write-Compile-Fix Loop Latency

Programming Rust is a long game. It's common to see beginners spending lots of energy switching back and forth between their editor and a terminal to run rustc, and then scrolling around to find the next error that they want to fix. This is high-friction, and will tire you out faster than if this was automated.

There is a cargo plugin called `cargo watch` that will look for changes in source files descendent from the current working directory, and then run `cargo check` which skips the LLVM codegen and only looks for compilation errors in your Rust code. It can be installed by typing `cargo install cargo-watch`.

You can use the `cargo watch` plugin to call a specific command when your code changes as well. I like to filter out the lines after the beginning of the error messages, after clearing the terminal:

```bash
cargo watch -s 'clear; cargo check --tests --color=always 2>&1 | head -40'
```

This way I just save my code and it shows the next error.

## Editor support for jumping to compiler errors

To go even farther than the last section, most editors have support for jumping to the next Rust error. In vim, you can use the `vim.rust` plugin in combination with Syntastic to automatically run rustc when you save a file, and to jump to errors using a keybind. Emacs users can use `flycheck-rust` for similar functionality. 

# Lockdown

This section is about preventing undesirable usage.

### Never

To make a type that can never be created, simply create an empty enum. Use this where you want to prevent compilation of specific codepaths.

```rust
enum Never {}

let never = Never:: // oh yeah, can't actually create one...
```

### Making traits unimplementable

If you want to prevent others from implementing your Trait, use the following pattern to "seal" it so that only your implementations will ever exist. Seen in tokio-tls.

```rust
mod sealed {
    pub trait Sealed {}
}

// must have access to sealed::Sealed to
// implement this trait, which is not possible
// for other crates etc...
pub trait MyPublicTrait: sealed::Sealed {}

pub struct MyStruct;

impl sealed::Sealed for MyStruct {}

impl MyPublicTrait for MyStruct {}
```

### Deactivating Mutability
Here's a pattern for disabling mutability for "finalized" objects, even in mutable owned copies of a thing, preventing misuse. Done by wrapping it in a newtype with a private inner value that implements Deref but not DerefMut:

```rust
mod config {
    #[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialOrd, Ord, Eq, PartialEq)]
    pub struct Immutable<T>(T);

    impl<T> Copy for Immutable<T> where T: Copy {}

    impl<T> std::ops::Deref for Immutable<T> {
        type Target = T;

        fn deref(&self) -> &T {
            &self.0
        }
    }
    
    #[derive(Default)]
    pub struct Config {
        pub a: usize,
        pub b: String,
    }
    
    impl Config {
        pub fn build(self) -> Immutable<Config> {
            Immutable(self)
        }
    }
}

use config::Config;

fn main() {
    let mut under_construction = Config {
        a: 5,
        b: "yo".into(),
    };
    
    under_construction.a = 6;
    
    let finalized = under_construction.build();
    
    // at this point, you can make tons of copies,
    // and even if somebody has an owned local version,
    // they won't be able to accidentally change some
    // configuration that
    println!("finalized.a: {}", finalized.a);
    
    let mut finalized = finalized;
    
    // the below WON'T work bwahahaha
    // finalized.a = 666;
    // finalized.0.a = 666;
}
```

### `Box<FnOnce>`

Currently, it's not possible to call `Box<FnOnce(T) -> R>` on stable Rust. The
common workaround is to use `Box<FnMut(T) -> R>`, store internal state inside of
an `Option` and `take` the state out (with a potential run-time panic) in the
call. However, a solution that statically guarantees that fn can be called at
most once is possible. Seen in [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/dc83ead224d8622f748f507574e1448a28d8dcc7/src/cargo/core/compiler/job.rs#L17-L25).

```rust
trait FnBox<A, R> {
    fn call_box(self: Box<Self>, a: A) -> R;
}

impl<A, R, F: FnOnce(A) -> R> FnBox<A, R> for F {
    fn call_box(self: Box<F>, a: A) -> R {
        (*self)(a)
    }
}

fn demo(f: Box<dyn FnBox<(), String>>) -> String {
    f.call_box(())
}

#[test]
fn test_demo() {
    let hello = "hello".to_string();
    let f: Box<dyn FnBox<(), String>> = Box::new(move |()| hello);
    assert_eq!(&demo(f), "hello");
}
```

Note that `self: Box<Self>` is stable and object-safe.
