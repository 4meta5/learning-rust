# Cryptography

> just playing around implementing cryptography in Rust; if I come up with anything *original*, I'll set it up in its own github repo but, for now, this is just for practice with Rust and Cryptography together

* primtives
    * hashing
    * experimentation with data structures (and relevant notes)
* algebra
* erasure
    * shamir's secret sharing scheme (ssss)
    

## TODO
* Reed-Solomon Erasure Encoding
    * [The Codes of Solomon, Reed and Muller](https://jeremykun.com/2015/03/23/the-codes-of-solomon-reed-and-muller/) -- Jeremy Kun (read the two articles before as well on Information Theory and Hamming Codes)
* Zero Knowledge Practice *(consider making into own repo)*
* MPC practice *(consider making into own repo)*
