# Cryptography

> just playing around implementing cryptography in Rust; if I come up with anything *original*, I'll set it up in its own github repo but, for now, this is just for practice with Rust and Cryptography together

* primitives
    * hashing
    * implementation of HashMap and HashSet for `no_std` environments: [Amanieu repo](https://github.com/Amanieu/hashmap_core)
    * merkle_tree [naive implementation](https://github.com/niklasad1/merkle-tree-rs); also Rusty Secrets implemented this

## TODO
* Shamir Secret Sharing
* Reed-Solomon Erasure Encoding
* MPC practice

* Algebra: [Nikolay Volf's repo](https://github.com/NikVolf/ng)
