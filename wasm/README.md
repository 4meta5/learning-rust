# WASM Notes and Code

* [Rust WASM frontend framework comparison](https://github.com/flosse/rust-web-framework-comparison/blob/master/README.md#frontend-frameworks-wasm)
    * [Seed](https://github.com/David-OConnor/seed) looks worth looking into (inspired by Elm)

* [WASM on the Blockchain: The Lesser Evil](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/wasm-on-the-blockchain-the-lesser-evil-da8d7c6ef6bd)

* [Rust and WebAssembly in 2019](http://fitzgeraldnick.com/2018/12/14/rust-and-webassembly-in-2019.html)

* [Interesting WebAssembly (github) issue with some compiler stuff](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/796)

* [nebulet/nebulet](https://github.com/nebulet/nebulet?files=1)
    * Nebulet is a microkernel that executes WebAssembly modules in ring 0 and a single address space to increase performance. This allows for low context-switch overhead, syscalls just being function calls, and exotic optimizations that simply would not be possible on conventional operating systems. The WebAssembly is verified, and due to a trick used to optimize out bounds-checking, unable to even represent the act of writing or reading outside its assigned linear memory.
